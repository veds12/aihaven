# Graph Convolutional Networks

Framework used : PyTorch

## layers.py

```
 from layers import gcn_layer

 mygcn = gcn_layer(ipsize, opsize)
 out = mygcn.compute(A, features)
```

* ipsize - Number of features per node in the input
* opsize - Number of features per node in the output
* A - A numpy adjacency matrix representing the graph (without self loops)
* features - Feature (numpy) matrix of the graph nodes

### Attributes

* weights - Trainable parameter of the layer of size (ipsize x opsize)
* D - The diagonal normalising matrix
* compute(A, features) - Propagate through the layer. Returns the ouput numpy array

## Current Tasks 

- [x] Write a script defining a gcn layer
- [ ] Define the model
- [ ] train.py
